# PsiMedia

PsiMedia is a thick abstraction layer for providing audio and video RTP services to Psi-like IM clients. The implementation is based on GStreamer.

For more information, see [this article](http://jblog.andbit.net/2008/07/03/introducing-psimedia/).

Currently it is used for video- and audio-calls support in [Psi IM](https://psi-im.org/) and [Psi+](https://psi-plus.com/) projects.

## Usage

Contents:

```
psimedia/      API and plugin shim
gstprovider/   provider plugin based on GStreamer
demo/          demonstration GUI program
```

To build the plugin and demo program, run:

```sh
qt-qconf
./configure
make
```
There is no "make install" target in this case. The compiled plugin can be found under the gstprovider directory. An application that uses PsiMedia should have instructions on what to do with the plugin.


Alternatively you may build plugin and demo using `cmake`:
```sh
mkdir -p builddir
cd builddir
cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
make
```
There is special "make install" target in this case oriented to Psi IM users, see:
```
make install DESTDIR=./out
tree ./out
```
